Using GROUP BY

The GROUP BY clause groups rows with the same values, effectively removing duplicates.

SELECT column1, column2
FROM your_table
GROUP BY column1, column2;



Using ROW_NUMBER() with CTE

The ROW_NUMBER() function assigns a unique number to each row within a partition. Filtering rows with ROW_NUMBER = 1 ensures uniqueness.

WITH cte AS (
SELECT column1, column2,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1, column2 ORDER BY column1) AS row_num
FROM your_table
)
SELECT column1, column2
FROM cte
WHERE row_num = 1;

Using UNION

The UNION operator combines result sets and removes duplicates automatically.

SELECT column1, column2
FROM your_table
UNION
SELECT column1, column2
FROM your_table;



Using INTERSECT

The INTERSECT operator returns only the rows that appear in both result sets, ensuring uniqueness.

SELECT column1, column2
FROM your_table
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2
FROM your_table;
